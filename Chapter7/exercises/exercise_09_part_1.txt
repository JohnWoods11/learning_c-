Think of three improvements that could be made to the calculator.

1:
After a non fatal error the calculator could return to a state where it is ready for input rather than requireing print to be entered
before it prompts for next input.

Implemented.

2:
The calculator could come with more functions, things like cos or tan or even the permutation and combination functions from the previous chapter.

3:
The calculator could come with regularly used constants such as pi, e, c among others.
